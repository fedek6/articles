## Apple part

### Apple Developer login

Login to [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/) and go to [account](https://developer.apple.com/account/).

### Create app ID

Go to [Identifiers](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list).

In the upper right corner select `App IDs` and click `+`.

Select `App IDs` in the list (should be selected by default) and click `Continue`. 

Select `App` and click `Continue`.

Write your app description (for eg. "Auth0 dev login") and fill in the `Bundle ID` field. It should be in the format of `com.yourdomain.yourappname`.

In the list of capabilites select `Sign in with Apple` and click `Continue`.

### Create service ID

In the upper right corner select `Services IDs` and click `+`.

Select `Services IDs` in the list (should be selected by default) and click `Continue`.

Type your description (for eg. "Auth0 dev login") and fill in the `Identifier` field. It should be in the format of `com.yourdomain.yourappname.client`.

Click `Continue`.

After successful creation of the service ID click service name on the list and enable `Sign in with Apple` capability.

Now press `Configure` button and select your primary app ID from the list. Carefully configure domains and subdomains (it must be configured like in the Auth0 app). 

> If you want to use `Test connection` from Auth0 dashboard you must also add `[your tenant].[region].auth0.com/login/callback` to return URLs.

Finish configuration by clicking `Save`.

### Create key

Go to keys list and click `+`.

Enter your key name (for eg. "Auth0 dev login") and select `Sign in with Apple` capability.

Click edit button and select your primary app ID from the list.

Click `continue` and `register`.

Download your key and copy its id. You will need it later.

## Auth0 part

Login to Auth0 account. Enable Apple connection in `Connections` tab.

- In `Client ID` field enter your service ID (the reversed domain name from second Apple step `com.yourdomain.yourappname.client`). 

- In `Client Secret Signing Key` paste downloaded key.

- In `Apple Team ID` field enter your team ID (you can find it in your Apple Developer account, right top corner, random chars like *****FXD).

- In `Key ID` field paste copied key id.
