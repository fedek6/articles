Here are some basic Git scenarios that I use on a daily basis.

## Clone remote repository & switch to a specific remote branch

In this scenario Git will automatically create a local branch with the same name as the remote branch.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:foo/bar.git
cd bar
git branch -r
git switch [remote-branch]
```

## Create a new branch from current branch

This will create a new branch from the current branch and automatically switch to it.

```bash
git checkout -b [new-branch] $(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)
```

## Reset branch to remote HEAD

If you have any problems with your local branch and want to reset it to the remote HEAD, you can do it with the following commands.

```bash
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/master
```
