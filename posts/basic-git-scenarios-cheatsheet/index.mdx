Here is a list of basic git commands that I use on a daily basis. I hope you find it useful!

## Clone remote repository & switch to a specific remote branch

In this scenario Git will automatically create a local branch with the same name as the remote branch.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:foo/bar.git
cd bar
git branch -r
git switch remote-brach
```

## Create a new branch from current branch

This will create a new branch from the current branch and switch to it.

```bash
git checkout -b foo-bar $(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)
```
